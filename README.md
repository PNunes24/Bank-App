# Bank-App
A Web App using Java that simulates Transactions between different Users in a Bank.

Why a bank? A banking system covers a lot of the functionality and responsibilities of a typical enterprise application, such as:

    User Interface
    Client/Server Architecture
    Relational Databases
    Database Transactions

Java-bank incorporates many of the core Java programming-language concepts taught previously and introduces some of the libraries, frameworks, 
and tools encountered in the Java ecosystem for building modern applications better and faster.
